> Visually view design assets saved on your computer

As a designer, I've hoarded design assets that I imagine I'll use at some point on a project. Then I realized I hate having to dig through all the folders to find the perfect asset and end up never using any of them.

So I created a way to look through a visual library of my assets to quickly find the perfect fit.
